# Overview

This is a very dummy project just to showcase how someone may `HELLO WORLD` using their own terminal commmands
instead of printing the message right away. 

The software does utilize the python programming language and requires it to be installed. 
Once installed, this program can be run on the terminal itself through:

```shell
$ python3 
imple_hello_world.py
```

Or it can be run on your favorite IDE if it supports python3 programs.

# Motivation

This is intended just to showcase how programming languages are able to directly 
interact with the terminal as any user would. Programming languages are cool!

# Development Environment

Python3 should have been installed prior to running this program. 
Check out [python3 Docs](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) to install it.

python3 is a very beginner-friendly language. It is not statically typed, rather it is dynamically typed.
